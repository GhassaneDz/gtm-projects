#+TITLE: bFlyCollect

* Principle

bFlyCollect is a small interface for butterfly collectors. It uses the
Strategy pattern in order to choose between two collection strategies
at runtime:

- Nailing down the butterfly on a wooden board;
- Putting the butterfly in a box.

* How to use

You will be asked for your name, then for some butterflies to collect
(species and color).
  
Using the jar archive:
  
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  java -jar bFlyCollect.jar
#+END_SRC

Afterwards you can choose your collecting strategy and see the results
:)
